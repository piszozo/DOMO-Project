Only people holding Domocoins in their wallet will be able to login to the Network. This way mostly only 'crypto' and blockchain enthusiasts will join the Community and create an environment Cryptotwitter is dreaming of. After reaching a decent amount of unique users within the prototype, we will do a official crowdfunding to develop a open source, decentralized, autonomous social network, which is not run by a single entity or centralized servers. This is your chance to join the team in early stages, earn a masternode for your effort and be hired to build a social network, which can´t be taken down by institutions and is maintained by the people actually using it.",
