Only people holding Domocoins in their wallet will be able to participate in the Network. This way, mostly only 'crypto' and blockchain enthusiasts will join our community and together we will create an environment Crypto-Twitter is dreaming of. After reaching a decent amount of unique users within the prototype, we will do aa official crowdfunding to develop an open source, decentralized, autonomous social network, which is not run by a single entity or centralized servers. This is your chance to join the team in early stages, earn a masternode for your efforts and be hired to build a social network, which can´t be taken down by institutions and is maintained by the people actually using it.",
